# What is a requirement?
Ranges from a high-level, abstract statement of a service of system constraint to a detailed mathematical functional specification. 

requirements serve to bid on a contract, and to create a contract.

# Types of requirements
* User requirements
	requirements in natural language. "The system allow allow me to enter using a password"
	meant for executives, end users, managers, system architects.
* System requirements
	Structured. "The system will allow a pre-registered user to log in given the correct password, ID and a phone authentication"
	meant for end user, client engineers, software devs, system architects.

# Functional vs Non-Functional requirements vs Domain
* Functional:
	what should the system be able to do. for example: the system will have 5 screens.
* Non-Functional: 
	describes constraints, general characteristics for example: "it will have a comfortable UI"
* Domain:
	constraints from a domain that has specific requirements and require a domain expert to define.

# Requirement imprecision
* Natural language:
	easy to understand but open for interpretation by having multi-meaning. 

# Complete and Consistent
Requirements have to be complete (include all aspects relevant) and consistent (no conflicts or contradictions).

# Metric for specifying nonfunctional requirements
speed
size
ease of use
reliability
robustness
portability

# Software requirement document
it is the official statement of what is required of the system developers. should include both a definition of user requirement and specifications of system requirements. not a design document, as it tells us WHAT is required and not HOW it will be implemented.

this document is used by system customers, managers, engineers, test engineers, maintenance engineers.

# Agile method in this context
it takes a lot of effort and time to create a requirement document - which is in contrast with agile's fast paced style. therefore agile methods use incremental requirements and express the requirements as "user stories".


# Requirement document variability
varies by the information it holds - which fits the type of system
.......

# Structure of requirements document
one general structure could be:
preface -> introduction -> glossary -> user requirements -> system architecture -> system requirement specification -> system models (UML/DML/ERD..) -> system evolution -> appendices -> index
glossary - dictionary for technical words.

# Requirements specification
it is the process of writing down user and system requirements. 
user requirements have to be understandable by end-users and customers without technical background. system requirements are more detailed. 
# Way of writing system requirements
Natural language
structural language
design description languages
graphical notations
mathematical specifications
# Guidelines for writing requirements
invent a standard format and use it globally
use language in a consistent way.

# Requirements Engineering
the process depends on the domain, however there are some generic activities common to all:
1. [[Requirements Elicitation]]/discovery: talk to client, research and gathering info.
2. requirements analysis/classification: find contradictions,..
3. [[Requirements Validation]]: testing edge cases, what contradicts..
4. [[Requirements Management]]: decision together with customer. 
this is iterative. 

# Changing Requirements
business and technical environment change frequently, causing the need or requirements to change.
