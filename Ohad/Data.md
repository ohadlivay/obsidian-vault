Raw collection of samples such as text, pictures, tables, audio, video.. 

[[Data]] Types:
Continuous (float) like weather or stock price.
Discrete - numbers in buckets. like number of students in class.
Nominal - categorical, such as genders or color of hair.
Ordinal - nominal with natural ordering. 

Another approach to classify seperates data into structured, unstructured and semi-structured. but this approach already assumes the data was handled.
