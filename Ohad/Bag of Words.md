each word from the [[Corpus]] is a feature. order does not matter.
OR 
tokens turn into features -> no preprocessing required
normalized words -> needs [[Lemmatization]] or [[Stemming]]
partial words -> prefix or suffix
[[ngrams]] -> unigrams, bigrams, trigrams (sequence of words)
characters ->use ngrams
