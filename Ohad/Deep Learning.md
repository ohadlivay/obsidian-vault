## Deep Learning Lec 1
### Intro
#### Technicalities
Lecturer email: rdror@is.haifa.ac.il
Acceptance Hour: Wednesday 11:00, email before.
#### Goals
* addition to CV
* learn whats is DL, hands-on.
* when to use DL, which [[Artifical Neural Network|nn]] to choose from.
* How to use DL

Learn using [[PyTorch]], helps to gain fundamentals. 

### What is deep learning 
a subcategory of [[Machine Learning]], with the goal of simulating intelligence. but in contrast to ML, we don't pre-define the features - they aren't hard coded. the model itself learns what is important and relevant.

### 
State of the art DL models can use [[Fine-tuning]]. 
### Project
Amongst a published list of papers, implement a net. also - suggest improvements and see if they improve it.
