A network of [[Nueron]]'s inspired by the brain. It is essentially a function, as it has inputs and outputs. the function has parameters which govern its behavior. A learning process is just finding these parameters (or weights); such that they fit the data. How are these parameters found? using [[Gradient Descent]]

The network has an input layer, [[Inner Layer]]s and an output layer.
