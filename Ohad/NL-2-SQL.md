*"Across both benchmarks, persona prompts usually had **little to no effect** on factual accuracy. For a given model and dataset, most persona conditions produced performance that was statistically indistinguishable from the Baseline (no persona) condition. When we did observe significant changes, they were **more often negative than positive**: low-knowledge personas tended to reduce accuracy in several models."*
