# Lecture 1
## Scope of SW Engineering
* Code
* Requirements
* Tests
* Environment (win11, linux..)
* Dependencies (libraries..)

## Essential Attributes of Good SW
* Maintainability
	ease of maintenance is critical due to customers changing and growing needs. documentation is essential. helps future maintainers understand important aspects of the code.
* Dependability and Security
	
* Efficiency
	time is money, code needs to run fast and efficiently. fast, efficient code saves IT resources.
* Acceptability
	software should match customer needs. it must be understandable, usable.

## SW Development methodologies
### Plan-driven
development according to plan, structured.
[[Waterfall]]
### [[Agile]]
Iterative development. sprints. working product after each iteration. 

## 4 things (?)
### Software Specification
the process of establishing which services are required and what the scope is of the system. 



## General issues that affect most SW
### Heterogeneity
increasingly, systems are required to operate in different environments (OS, mobile, web)
### Business and social change
software needs to adapt to social norms and societal rules and be specific or customized to fit different social groups.
### Security and trust
software integrates with different dependencies, so security guarantees are needed.
