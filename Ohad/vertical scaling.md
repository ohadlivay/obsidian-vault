add more cpu, cores, memory, disk space, network throughput. this means scaling the instance. 

NEGATIVE: 
- hardware doesnt scale to price
for example, memory prices: 
16gb -> 100$
32gb -> not 200$ might be 225$!
64gb -> 600$...

diminishing returns! 
* stability or availability is also a problem sicne we rely on few powerful machines.
