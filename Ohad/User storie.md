A method to turn requirements into smaller components. 

We list all requirements, sort them by priority. 
turn the requirement into a user story. if its scope is too big, can split into multiple user stories. set a timeframe to work on it. 

Template:
as a <type of user>, i want <some goal/need> so that <reason>
example:
as a user, i want to reserve a hotel room.
as a vacation traveler, i want to see photos of the hotel.

Effort estimation for user story
scoring each task according to how difficult or complex it is.
