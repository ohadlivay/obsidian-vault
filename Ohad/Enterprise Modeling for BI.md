Problem: BI analyst doesnt understand the business.

Models: Markov chains, SA(c?), UML,ERD,DFD,Petri nets, BPMN

Descriptive analytics models:
* KPI
* Dashboards and scoreboards: TableU
Diagnostic Analytics models
* RCA
* Data mining algorithms
Predictive analytics models
* Regression models
* time series analysis
* machine learning models
Prescritive analytics models
Text analytics models
* Sentiment analysis
* NLP
Data warehousing
OLAP models
ETL
Data visualization

Modeling motivation: they are tools to understand a business such that we can provide it with good BI.
Model definition: models represent some part of a business.  
* Phenomena modeling - turning machines
* Models of data: learn best model using machine learning, data mining (finds patterns where other modeling methods fail)
* Models of theories(!): model knowledge specific to domain. a way to embed knowledge to be applicable to programs.

Logic and algebraic structure
* Propositional and predicate logic
Constants, like John Dee
Variables: placeholder for constant, like Teacher
Functions: operations on constants like grade(Student)=passed
Predicates: define properties for individual constant. e.g; Birds can fly. it has a false value. 
Quantifiers: $\forall,\exists$

Petri nets
SAN - Stochastic Active Network
